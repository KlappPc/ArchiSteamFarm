I fully read and understood contributing guidelines of ASF available above, especially the point that GITHUB IS NOT TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND IT'S THE PLACE ONLY FOR ASF BUGS AND SUGGESTIONS.

I admit that THIS IS NOT A QUESTION OR TECHNICAL ISSUE caused by my lazyness of reading ASF wiki. I strongly believe that the bug I'm reporting here affects majority of ASF users, and the enhancement I'm suggesting could benefit ASF in long-run.

If my issue is not meeting contributing guidelines specified above, especially if it's a question or technical issue, please close my issue immediately - I won't complain.

Now that you read and understood the notice, feel free to remove it and fill with real issue.
